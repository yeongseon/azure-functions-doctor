## ü§î Why Azure Functions Doctor?

* You're getting random 500 errors and suspect misconfiguration?
* Need to verify your dev environment before CI/CD deployment?
* Want a quick health check without digging through docs?

This tool saves time by automating common Azure Functions environment diagnostics.

### üöÄ Key Features

* Diagnose Python version, venv, azure-functions package
* Validate host.json, local.settings.json, and function structure
* Fully customizable via `rules.json` (see [docs](https://yeongseon.github.io/azure-functions-doctor/rules/))

---

## ü©∫ Overview

**Azure Functions Doctor** is a Python-based CLI tool designed to diagnose and validate your local Azure Functions environment.
This tool helps identify configuration issues, missing dependencies, or version mismatches commonly found in Python-based Azure Functions.

The behavior and rules for each check are defined declaratively in the `rules.json` file located in the project root. This file allows users and developers to customize or extend validation logic without modifying Python code directly.
üìò Learn more: [rules.json documentation](https://yeongseon.github.io/azure-functions-doctor/rules/)

## ü™† Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Git
* Optional: Azure Function Core Tools v4 (`npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@4`)
* Recommended: Unix-like shell or PowerShell for Makefile support
