# Agent Playbook

## Source Of Truth
- `README.md` for architecture, usage, and exit-code expectations.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for diagnostic rule guidelines and contribution workflow.
- `pyproject.toml` and `Makefile` for supported commands and environments.

## Repository Map
- `src/azure_functions_doctor/` CLI and diagnostic logic.
- `tests/` regression coverage for rules and CLI behavior.
- `docs/` published documentation assets.

## Change Workflow
1. Read the existing diagnostic flow before changing rule behavior.
2. Keep command-line behavior stable unless the change explicitly updates the contract.
3. Add or update tests for every new rule, warning, or exit-path change.
4. Update `README.md` when usage examples, dependencies, or output semantics change.

## Validation
- `make install`
- `make test`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make build`
