# üõ†Ô∏è Release Process

This document outlines the steps to release a new version of **Azure Functions Doctor** to PyPI and update the changelog, using the existing Makefile and Hatch-based workflows.

---

## üßæ Step 1: Bump Version and Generate Changelog

Use the Makefile targets to bump the version and update the changelog:

```bash
# Patch release (e.g., v0.1.0 ‚Üí v0.1.1)
make release-patch

# Minor release (e.g., v0.1.1 ‚Üí v0.2.0)
make release-minor

# Major release (e.g., v0.2.0 ‚Üí v1.0.0)
make release-major
```

Each command will:
- Update the version in `pyproject.toml` and `src/azure_functions_doctor/__init__.py`
- Generate or update `CHANGELOG.md` based on Git commit history (`git-cliff`)
- Commit the updated changelog and version bump
- Create a Git tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
- Push commits and tags to the `main` branch

> **Tip**: Ensure your local branch is up-to-date with `main` before running these commands.

## üì¶ Step 2: Build and Test the Package

Before publishing, build and verify locally:

```bash
# Create source and wheel distributions
make build

# (Optional) Install from the local distribution to test
pip install dist/azure_functions_doctor-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

Verify installation:

```bash
azfunc-doctor --version
```

---

## üöÄ Step 3: Publish to PyPI

Once the build artifacts are validated, upload the package to PyPI:

```bash
make publish
```

This runs:
- `hatch release` under the hood (builds, signs if configured, and uploads)
- Uses credentials from `~/.pypirc` or environment variables (`PYPI_USERNAME`/`PYPI_PASSWORD`)
- Verifies successful upload by checking PyPI listing

> **Security**: Ensure that your PyPI API token or credentials are stored securely and not committed to source control.

---

## üîÅ Step 4: Test on TestPyPI (Optional)

If you want to verify the upload workflow without affecting production releases:

1. Build the package:

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. Upload to TestPyPI:

   ```bash
   twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   ```

3. Install from TestPyPI:

   ```bash
   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ azure-functions-doctor
   ```

4. Verify version:

   ```bash
   azfunc-doctor --version
   ```
